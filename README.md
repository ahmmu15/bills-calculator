Calculating your shared flat bills is a breeze with **Bills Calculator!** :D

========

Hi guys! I'm Ahmed, and I'm living in a shared flat where mates come and go in a matter of couple months. Managing the bills is a *headache for me*, since the flat can be rented by 1-6 or even seven people! You can imagine how messy this can be.

To save my time, I created this calculator, it's *very basic*, yet **very powerfull**. Everything made using old friends (*HTML, CSS, and jQuery*), with easy to follow instructions within the code (*as comments*).

Grab it now, and feel free to **customize it** the way you like, it's yours after all. :)
